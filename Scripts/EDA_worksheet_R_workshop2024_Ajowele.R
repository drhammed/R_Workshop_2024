#install and load required package####


#load package



#load iris data####


#check variables in iris data


#How many individuals of each species were measured?####
#How many species were considered?

#so, how many individuals and how many species?

#What is the distribution of Sepal_Length?####


#What is the distribution of Sepal_Length by species?####

#specify a binwidth

#What species do you think has the shortest sepal length?

#Exercise 1: Show the distribution of Sepal Width for each species####

#what species do you think has the widest sepal?

#much easier to view multiple category ####
#with frequency polygon than histogram
#use petal length


#what species do you think has the longest petal?

#Is there a relationship between sepal length and sepal width?####

#Describe the relationship.

#Exercise 2:####
#Is there a relationship between sepal length and sepal width 
#within each species?


#Is there a petal length by width relationship?####




#any relationship between sepal and petal length?####


#any relationship between sepal and petal width?####

 
  

#making a multipanel figure####



#make axes different for each species####

  
  

#assigning figures to object####
